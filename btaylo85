Hi, I’m Brandon Taylor.

I’m interested in graphic design, particularly in the realm of minimalist design and typography.

I’m currently learning front-end web development to expand my skill set and create more interactive digital experiences.

I’m looking to collaborate on projects that merge design and technology, such as website redesigns or branding campaigns for social causes.

You can reach me via email at btaylo85@asu.edu or DM me on Twitter @brandon_designs.

Pronouns: he/him

Fun fact: I'm also a musician and love playing jazz piano in my spare time.
